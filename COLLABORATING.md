For code, please follow the style guide defined in `STYLEGUIDE.md`.

# Git

We will use git to manage our project. [This][1] is a great resource for
understanding git's underlying model. We will use some sort of branching
strategy/model that has not yet been solidified. Each commit should ideally
address a specific change and the commit message should be clear, concise, and
informative (should also include the names of the files/modules addressed). For
example, `creator.c: fix segmentation fault in main`. Commit messages are also
generally written in the imperative.
