# Testing


__Small notes, format later:__

Based on what is visible to the output, our solver does not change any given values.

Additionally, for a solution to be found, the puzzle MUST be valid (based on our recursive algorithm logic, and ALSO we check whether or not the puzzle is valid
before we even run the algorithm anyways.)

Commentary on creator: our solver and unique puzzle creator run with the same exact function--might be good for further development of this project to have an independent unique-ness checker, though we are pretty confident about our algorithm.
